                As we all know, the role of biotechnology have been more and more important in modern manufacturing. We believe that, the bio-manufacture industry will replace the traditional chemical producing progress and become the most important progress. Optimizing the pathway in manufacture have shown its importance. 
<p>Fermentor, as the important tools in biomanufacture, should be considered as a complex rather than a simple machine. During contemporary industrial fermentation, a lot of heat are released. Without control, it may even rise to 50 ℃(not good for most engineering bacteria)We always use the cooling water to control the elevated temperature,which result in consumption of energy.By the way, the maximum of microorganism density is not always the best for production efficiency. Under this circumstance, improving the ability of engineering bacteria to resist hot environment and controlling their density in an appropriate area is necessary. Let’s set Escherichia.coli as an example . </p>

                </p>

                    <div class="com">Figure 1: Environmental toxins contaminate air, water, and land masses. These can consist of various compounds which could be divided into sulfur, nitrogen, carboxylic acid, and phenolic based compounds. What can we do to solve this problem?</div>
                </div>
                <p>Here, in figure A, we can see the normal condition: there’re a lot of E.coli working, but it’s not crowded, and the temperature is perfect.</p>
                <p>
  But this perfect condition cannot last forever .The temperature goes up with the fermentation process. Sooner or later, all the E.coli are in danger! They feel like live in fire. We could, just as what we do before, use our machine to put up the “fire”, which, as I said before, will consume a lot of energy. But what if the E.coli get organized, and put out the fire with some weapons(HSPs) and sacrificing a small part of them, leave nutrition to the others?</p>
  <p>
  That is just what we want, like picture B, E.coli get together to fight with fire, so that they can survive in a hotter environment.
But the temperature is sill going up with density. Too crowded! There must be a way to decrease the density and to cool down the fermentor! When the temperature reaches the “red alarm” level, some brave E.coli will sacrifice themselves to decrease the density up to an appropriate number. With the decreasing of density, less heat is generated, the fermentor return back to a perfect condition. The sacrifice of those E.coli contributes to the production efficiency, just like the dead encourage the live.

                    <h3>How to “lead” the E.Coli fight with heat?</h3>

                    <p> 
 There is a protein family called HSP. They can help cells to fix the damage caused by heat by  restoring the protein back to normal condition. In our design, HSP are controlled by a kind of RNA switch. The special mRNA have a stem-circle structure, which can prevent the code in the mRNA from being translated. Once the temperature reaches the level we set, the stem-circle will transform to normal condition, which means that the switch will open automatically. As a result, Ecoli can keep their producing ability, ignoring the relatively hot environment.  That is the weapon we give to E.coli to fight with heat. This device is our forth device.

            <h3>How can the E.coli sacrifice themselves?</h3>
    <p> Maybe many people think bacteria are selfish creatures, but that is not totally true. MazEF, is a widely used system among wide bacteria. With this system, many bacteria will sacrifice themselves, and leave nutrition to the left ones when facing threats from dangerous environment, such as heat, lack of food and so on. MazF , which has RNA cleavage activity, is a kind of toxin. MazE, on the other hand, is the antidote of MazF. When MazE can combine with MazF, the cell will not be harmed. But once we inhibit the production of MazE, the cell step into programmed cell death(PCD). In our design, we add our MazEF into E.coli, so once the pathway was open, E.coli will be ready for sacrifice. That is our third device. </p>

        <h3>How can you ensure the “sacrifice” will not become group suicide? In other words, how can you control the number of E.coli who sacrifice?</h4>
        <p>Actually our inhibition on the production of MazE will not last long. We set a oscillating pathway to control the inhibition to ensure the MazE is much enough to keep most E.coli in a normal condition. The inhibition will be intermittent, not continuous. That is our second device. The simple description is A inhibit B, B inhibit C, and C inhibit A, they become a cycle.</p>

            <p>The whole pathway begin from AHL, which is linear connected to the cell density. The AHL will combine with a protein called LuxR, and form a complex. When the complex reaches a level, it will activate the intermittent pathway, which is the second device. This AHL part is our first device, the beginning of our whole pathway.</p>

    <div class="section hero">
        <img src="./img/project/RNAth.PNG" style="float:left;margin-right:30px;">
        <p>Bacteria use complex strategies to control gene expression in response to environment temperature changing. Many genes encoding heat shock proteins and virulence factors are regulated by temperature sensing RNA sequences, known as RNA thermometers (RNATs), which are located in the 5’untranslated region of the mRNA folding into secondary structure that shed RBS to influence translational efficiency in low temperature. But when temperature is increased to a certain temperature, the RNATS release RBS and the blocked genes express.</p>
        <img src="./img/project/RNAth_1.png" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;">
        <p>Most of gene expression responding to temperature shock measure not the temperature itself but the consequences of temperature-induced damage. Those reaction are effected by temperature indirectly. However, RNA thermometers response to temperature immediately, precisely, and controllably. So using RNA thermometers to control our heat shock proteins expression is a good choice. The RNA thermometers can be available included two types, the natural RNATS and the synthetic RNATS.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Natural RNATS</h3>
        <img src="./img/project/RNAth_naturalRNATS.png" style="width:350px;float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:20px;">
        <h2>ROSE family</h2>
        <p><b> ROSE RNATS</b> were found in numerous alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria. All known ROSE elements control the expression of small heat shock genes. ROSE-type structures are composed of two, three or four individual hairpins. The 5ʹ-most hairpins remain stable under heat shock conditions, but the 3ʹ-most hairpin that pairs with the SD sequence is only stable at low temperatures. Temperature-induced local melting in this hairpin exposes the SD sequence, facilitating ribosome binding. The SD region is occluded at 30 °C, partial melting occurs at 37 °C, whereas an increase to 42 °C facilitates the mRNA–ribosome interaction owing to full liberation of the SD and AUG start codon. This type feeds our needs. It may not initiate translation at a certain temperature completely, but the level of expression increase alone with the temperature increasing.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Four U family</h2>

        <img src="./img/project/RNAth_FourUfamily.png" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;">
        <p>Another family of RNATs is a stretch of four uridines that pairs with AGGA in the SD sequence. FourU elements exist in the 5ʹ UTRs of several heat shock and virulence genes. It has two distinct hairpins. The first hairpin is heat stable, however the second hairpin is temperature sensitive, which hide the SD region through the fourU. The formation of the ternary translation initiation complex occurs at high (45 °C) but not at low (30 °C) temperatures.</p>

        <h3>Synthetic RNA thermometers</h3>
        <p>Obvious, RNA thermometers provide us superb genetic tools to induce or repress gene expression. However, most natural RNA thermometers are relatively large. They fold into rather complex secondary structures and have been suggested to undergo gradual conformational changes in response to changes in temperature. Therefore, we want to construct smaller and more convenient synthetic RNA thermometers to achieve the goal of hierarchy Heat-resistant regulation. Under the following principle we construct a series of synthetic RNA thermometers.</p>
        <p>Stem stability can be influenced by (i) changes in the size and/or GC content of a perfectly matched stem and (ii) introduction of mismatches at different positions.</p>

        <img src="./img/project/HSPs.png" style="float:left;margin-right:30px;">
        <p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins induced by heat shock, the most prominent members of this group are a class of functionally related proteins named chaperones which are involved in the folding and unfolding of other proteins. Their expression is increased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stress. The dramatic upregulation of the heat shock proteins is a key part of the heat shock response heat resistance. </p>
        <p>HSPs are ubiquitous in all living organisms, eapecially the HSPs of Thermophilic Archaea have important biological value. In our project, we selected five highly effective genes,including dnaK, dnaJ, ThiF, GroeL and GroeS.</p>
        <p>DnaK is one of the Hsp70 proteins expressed in prokaryotes. The bacterial molecular chaperone DnaK is an enzyme that couples cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release by an N-terminal ATP-hydrolizing domain to cycles of sequestration and release of unfolded proteins by a C-terminal substrate binding domain. By binding tightly to partially synthesized peptide sequences (incomplete proteins), Hsp70 prevents them from aggregating and being rendered nonfunctional. Once the entire protein is synthesized, a nucleotide exchange factor (BAG-1 and HspBP1 are among those which have been identified) stimulates the release of ADP and binding of fresh ATP, opening the binding pocket. The protein is then free to fold on its own, or to be transferred to other chaperones for further processing. DnaK also aids in transmembrane transport of proteins, by stabilizing them in a partially folded state.</p>

        <p>DnaJ is another cochaperone work with DnaK in ATP hydrolysis. Meanwhile, DnaJ also associates with unfolded polypeptide chains and prevents their aggregation</p>
        <p>GroEL belongs to the chaperonin family of molecular chaperones, and is found in a large number of bacteria. It is required for the proper folding of many proteins. To function properly, GroEL requires the lid-like cochaperonin protein complex GroES</p>

        <p>It is obvious that a part of our work aim to control the density.  For at the beginning of the fermentation progress the density needs to be improved, it is inappropriate for the density controlling system to run. This density controlling system can be opened only when the cell density is high enough. To settle this problem, we add the quorum sensing device. We use AHL as the symbol of cell density. Cells keep expressing AHL, so that the density of AHL rises with the rise of cell density. There is a kind of protein called LuxR, which can combine with AHL and become a complex. The complex can inhibit downstream gene tetR. The existence of TetR(expressed from tetR) block the oscillation device(wich will be introduced later). As the density of AHL rises, there will be more and more complexes. Then more and more tetR will be inhibited. The oscillation device is activated step by step. The function of this device is to ensure the oscillation device is opened only when the cell density is high enough, so that the oscillation will not block the normal proliferation of E.coli.</p>

        <p>The C I expressed in oscillation device will activate PCD device. The main part of this device is MazEF system. MazEF system is a toxin-antitoxin system .MazF , which has RNA cleavage activity, is a kind of toxin. MazE, on the other hand, is the antidote of MazF. In nature, many bacteria will sacrifice themselves, and leave nutrition to the left ones With this systemwhen facing threats from dangerous environment, such as heat, lack of food and so on. Before the device is activate, both MazE and MazF are expressed. These substance will combine together to form a hexamer, which do no harm to cells. Once CI is expressed, the expression of MazE will be inhibited. No more hexamer will be formed, and MazF will show it’s power. Because of mazF, the density of cell will decrease. When the density is too low that cannot activate quorum sensing system to activate oscillation system, there will be no CI. After that, the MazE will be expressed again, which will save the cells from the hand of MazF.</p>

            <p>
The organisms used in our experiment conclude:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="component-sprite"></span>Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)</li>
        <li><span class="component-sprite"></span>Escherichia coli K12</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
Although all of the organisms are in line with biosafety level 1 (BSL), we have treated it as a potential affection source and created following rules to minimize the danger:
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="component-sprite"></span>Wearing appropriate protective equipment like gloves and lab coats. </li>
    <li><span class="component-sprite"></span>Don’t eat any food or store it in the lab.</li>
    <li><span class="component-sprite"></span>Avoid wearing shorts or shoes that make your legs or toes exposed.</li>
    <li><span class="component-sprite"></span>Washing hands before leaving the laboratory.</li>

            <h3>Safety training</h3>
            <p>
There is no Biosafety Committee at our university, only a bio-safety officer. Nevertheless, we have iGEM instructors, Dr. Chun Li and Dr. Shuyuan Guo, who trained us about the project progress regularly and is responsible for the bio-safety of our project. The general rule at our university is that every student has to take part in specific safety training before their first experiment. Further, once a year, every member of the lab is required to take a refreshment course in lab safety, bio safety, fire safety, waste management, handling gas cylinders and working with hazardous materials. All of these treatments ensure our lab safety.

            <h3>Public & Environment safety</h3>
            <p>
The model organisms used in our project are non-virulent strains which are commonly used in microbiology laboratories. The organism has been provided various resistance of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin and kanamycin. Without the circumstance which contained specific antibiotic, our organism has no advantage in the competition with the wild one. Besides, although we have improve its resistance of higher temperature(42~45℃), it can still be denatured via heat. In a word, it can work well in laboratory environment and will be eliminated through competition when exposing in the wild.
