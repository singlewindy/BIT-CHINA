                As we all know, the role of biotechnology have been more and more important in modern manufacturing. Fermentor, as the important tools in biomanufacture, should be considered as a complex rather than a simple machine. In fact, the heat produced by microorganism in fermentor will cause a large consumption of energy. By the way, the maximum of microorganism density is not always the best for production efficiency. Under this circumstance, to improve the ability of engineering bacteria to resist hot environment and to control their density in an appropriate area is necessary.

  Here, in figure A, we can see the normal condition: there’re a lot of E.Coli working, but it’s not crowded, and the temperature is perfect.
  But there will be more and more E.Coli! The temperature goes up with the density. With the temperature higher and higher, all the E.Coli are in danger! They feel like live in fire. We could, just as what we do before, use our machine to put up the “fire”, which, as I said before, will consume a lot of energy. But what if the E.Coli get organized, and put out the fire by sacrificing a small part of them, leave nutrition to the others?
  That is just what we want, like picture B, E.Coli get together to fight with fire, and some brave ones sacrifice themselves to decrease the density up to an appropriate number. With the decreasing of density, less heat is generated, the fermentor return cool. The sacrifice of them contribute to the production efficiency, just like the dead encourage the live.

                <div class="com">Figure 2: Introducing our dynamic duo FRED and OSCAR! This biosensor/bioreactor team is ready to detect and remediate toxins in the environment. Not only can OSCAR break down toxic carboxylic acid containing compounds such as naphthenic acids, but we also demonstrated that he can turn them into functional hydrocarbons!

        We would like to introduce FRED and OSCAR! Our dynamic biosensor/bioreactor duo is designed to detect toxic compounds such as the ones illustrated above in liquid waste and contaminated waters and to convert these toxic components into usable hydrocarbons.  FRED, the Functional Robust Electrochemical Detector, is capable of detecting various toxic components simultaneously through an electrochemical response.  Building on the single output <a class="blue" href="http://2011.igem.org/Team:Calgary">biosensor for NAs</a> that we developed last year, we set out to design a multiple output biosensor.  We illustrated how this sensor could work by showing that it has the potential to detect multiple toxins in contaminated water.  Additionally, we developed a miniaturized circuit of the potentiostat for the prototype, validated this device in the wetlab, and designed our own software, which we have made available to everyone.  
        </p>
        <p>
        OSCAR, the Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation, is designed specifically to target toxins such as naphthenic acids (carboxylic acid-containing compounds), catechol, and nitrogen and sulfur containing heterocyclic compounds. Using the PetroBrick (<a href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590025">BBa_K590025</a>) we were able to convert various naphthenic acid based compounds into their hydrocarbon analogs.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to degrade other toxic components of tailings so we used the <i>xylE</i> gene (<a href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J33204">BBa_J33204</a>) in order to cleave catechol, an abundant intermediate in many toxic areas.  Not only did we set out to break down catechol, but we attempted to see if we could further reduce the toxicity of the catechol breakdown product through use of the PetroBrick.  When we co-culture these genetic circuits we can selectively produce new compounds from catechol compared to with <i>xylE</i> alone, suggesting that the Petrobrick may be used to create new hydrocarbon based compounds! Lastly we wanted to remove sulfur and nitrogen from heterocycles using the <i>dsz</i> and <i>carA</i> operons respectively.  Not only would this improve the quality of fuel produced, but also prevent the production of NO<sub>x</sub>  and SO<sub>x</sub> during combustion, reducing the amount of air pollution produced from burning fuel.    </p>

        <p>Before starting our project, the Calgary iGEM team felt it would be important to <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Project/HumanPractices">answer a few questions</a> about how FRED and OSCAR could be applied in the oil and gas sector.</p>  
        <img src="img/project/UCalgary2012_FRED_and_OSCAR_HP.png" style="float: right; width: 200px; padding: 10px;"></img>
        <p><b>Would oilsands industry be interested in a biosensor and bioreactor for remediation purposes?</b> Yes! Our meeting with the Oilsands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) has affirmed that industry is interested in potentially using synthetic biology for remediation of toxins.</p> 
        <p><b>What would people think about using synthetic biology<img src="img/project/UCalgary2012_FRED_and_OSCAR_Interviews_Low-Res.png" style="float: left; padding: 10px; width: 200px;"></img>  in the oilsands? Do they have any concerns about its implementation?</b> We consulted with two professionals working in biotechnology and ecological development in Alberta.  Both of them emphasized that while the concept sounds great, it is important that we keep in mind the safety and ethics of our project.</p>  

        <p><b>How can OSCAR and FRED be designed with safety in mind?</b> From our various conversations our team looked toward both physical <img src="img/project/UCalgary2012_FRED_and_OSCAR_Design.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px; width: 200px;"></img>and genetic design considerations to ensure that from the outset, both FRED and OSCAR were designed in a safe and functional way.  This involved incorporating physical containment features in the  biosensor and bioreactor designs and employing biological kill switch mechanisms.</p> 

        <p><b>How can we teach people more about FRED, OSCAR, and Synthetic Biology?</b> From our interviews it was clear that not many people knew about synthetic biology or its applications in the oil and gas sector.  For this we partnered with the Telus Spark Centre, the local Science Centre in Calgary, to help communicate synthetic biology to them.  We also developed a video game that had its debut at the centre and educated adults and kids on synthetic biology in a fun way! </p>
